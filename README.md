> These are my dotfiles.
> There are many like them, but these are mine.
>
> My dotfiles are my best friends.
> They are my life.
> I must master them as I must master my system.

> Without me, my dotfiles are useless.
> Without my dotfiles, I am useless.
> I must configure my dotfiles true.
> I must shell faster than my error, who is trying to break my setup.
> I must fix it before it breaks me.
> I will.
>
> My dotfiles and I know that what counts in computing is not the lines we write,
> the editors we fight about,
> nor the bugs we make.
> We know that it is the setup that counts.
> We will set up.
>
> My dotfiles are human, even as I am human,
> because they are my life.
> Thus, I will learn them as a sibling.
> I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths,
> their plugins, their aliases, their variables, and their paths.
> I will keep my dotfiles clean and ready,
> even as I am clean and ready.
> We will become part of each other.
> We will.
>
> Before root, I swear this creed.
> My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my workflow.
> We are the masters of our system.
> We are the saviors of our productivity.
>
> So be it, until consistency is achieved and there is no more entropy,
> but peace.
