[Spoken Intro: Kim Gordon]
You're it
No, you're it
Hey, you're really it
You're it
No I mean it, you're it

Say it
Don't spray it
Spirit desire (face me)
Spirit desire (don't displace me)
Spirit desire
We will fall

Miss me
Don't dismiss me

Spirit desire
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Thurston Moore]
Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two

[Chorus 1]
Time to get it
Before you let it get to you
Here he comes now
Stick to your guns and let him through

[Verse 2]
Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

[Verse 3]
Ah, here it comes
I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you

[Chorus 2]
Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you
And it's not clear while you make the way

[Verse 4]
Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

[Verse 5]
It better work out
I hope it works out my way
Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
It takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

[Chorus 3]
You better look it
We're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero
We paint a zero on his hand

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 6]
We know it's down
We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and cooze

[Outro]
It's time to go round
A one man showdown teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now
And back on the road on the riot trail
