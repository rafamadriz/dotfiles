Stand behind his drunken amp
Stand behind his light of love
Hear him yowl his bloody tounge
Hear him yell 4 blood and war

[Chorus:]
Do you believe in his sweet sensation
Do you believe in second chance
Do you believe in rapture babe

A terrible hit strikes today
A terrible hit for the parade
Burnin' eyes seek jesus comin
Jesus comes to pave the way

[Chorus]

Can you tell me what to feel
Open up yr tender soul
Can I drink yr drunken mercy
Wine burns the devils hole

[Chorus]
